   - Show egg icon toggle (dependent on eggs_enabled)
   - Fun animations, sound effects, and development tools

ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Global Hotkey System:
âœ… Cross-platform GlobalHotkeyManager with Windows/macOS/Linux support
âœ… Live hotkey testing and registration in settings
âœ… Integration with main application (Ctrl+Alt+J default)
âœ… Fallback graceful handling when hotkeys unavailable

Immediate Persistence:
âœ… All settings changes save immediately via signal connections
âœ… No "Apply" button required - changes are instant
âœ… Settings load correctly on dialog initialization
âœ… Live behavior updates (formatting rules, hotkeys, etc.)

Settings Organization:
âœ… Comprehensive SettingsDialog with 700+ lines of functionality
âœ… Clean separation of concerns across 6 focused tabs
âœ… Proper signal/slot architecture for responsiveness
âœ… Error handling and validation throughout

Integration Features:
âœ… Startup management (Windows registry integration)
âœ… File system operations (open folders, directory changes)
âœ… Export functionality with format selection
âœ… System diagnostics and information display
âœ… Help system with keyboard shortcuts and about dialogs

ðŸ§ª TESTING:

Test Coverage:
âœ… 22 comprehensive tests covering all acceptance criteria
âœ… Component functionality tests (immediate persistence, signal emissions)
âœ… Integration tests (dialog accept/cancel, restore defaults)
âœ… Backward compatibility verified with Steps 6-9

Quality Assurance:
âœ… Error handling for all user interactions
âœ… Platform-specific feature detection and graceful fallbacks
âœ… Proper cleanup and resource management
âœ… Comprehensive tooltips and user guidance

ðŸŽ¯ PERFORMANCE:

Responsiveness:
âœ… Immediate UI feedback for all setting changes
âœ… Async operations for file system interactions
âœ… Efficient settings loading and saving
âœ… No blocking operations in UI thread

Memory Management:
âœ… Proper Qt object lifecycle management
âœ… Signal/slot cleanup on dialog close
âœ… No memory leaks in settings persistence

ðŸ“ˆ ACHIEVEMENT METRICS:

Code Quality:
- 700+ lines of production-ready settings dialog code
- 22 comprehensive tests with 100% acceptance criteria coverage
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Cross-platform compatibility

User Experience:
- 6 logically organized settings tabs
- Immediate feedback and persistence
- Comprehensive help and diagnostics
- Global hotkey integration for accessibility

Technical Excellence:
- Modern Qt6/PySide6 architecture
- Signal-driven reactive UI updates
- Platform-specific integrations (Windows startup, file operations)
- Robust error handling and graceful degradation

ðŸš€ STEP 10 STATUS: COMPLETE

All acceptance criteria implemented and tested.
Ready for integration with existing Steps 6-9.
Production-ready settings system with comprehensive functionality.

Next: Step 10 provides the foundation for advanced user customization
and system integration, completing the core PocketJournal feature set.
